# Seamless Background
 This is a small example of my implementation of the infinite (seamless) scrolling background which I've used for my Space Shooter game.

##
This repository containts two examples:

1. Infinite scrolling background
- Very simple and lightweight implementation
- Can be used with a single texture
- Axis of motion can be changed in any wanted direction with changing a single line of script
2. Camera following background with parallax effect
- More complex implementation
- Can be used with numerous textures 
- Doesn't depend on the axis of movement, but the parallax effect is achieved by the number of layers and it's value

##
Here's a small preview of both implementations:
